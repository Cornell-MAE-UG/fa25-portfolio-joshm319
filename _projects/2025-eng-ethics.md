## Boeing 737 MAX Ethical Analysis Summary

**Prepared by:** Joshua McCrae (jlm529) **Case Focus:** Ethical failures surrounding the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).

---

### Core Ethical Issues and Conflicts

There are five primary ethical dilemmas regarding Boeing's development and certification of the 737 MAX:

1. **Transparency:** Whether Boeing should have downplayed MCAS to the FAA and public . This represents a breach of integrity that directly hindered pilot emergency response.


2. **Accountability:** Boeing’s failure to take responsibility for the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. This moral failure delayed systemic changes that could have prevented the second tragedy.


3. **Regulatory Oversight:** Whether Boeing should have had the authority to self-certify MCAS without independent FAA intervention. This created a conflict of interest where financial pressure overrode safety.


4. **Documentation:** The deliberate omission of MCAS from plane documentation to avoid scrutiny .


5. **Market Pressure:** Allowing industry competition with Airbus to dictate design timelines and compromise engineering integrity.



**Primary Conflict:** Across all issues, **ASME Canon 1 (Public Safety)** repeatedly conflicted with **Canon 4 (Faithful Agency to Employer)**. The analysis concludes that public safety must always take absolute precedence over employer loyalty.

### Key Facts and Assumptions

* **Material Facts:** MCAS was introduced to the 737 MAX to maintain handling characteristics consistent with older versions due to larger engine placement. The system relied on a **single faulty AOA sensor**, creating a single point of failure.


* **Missing Facts/Assumptions:** While the exact internal code review process is unknown, it is assumed to have been non-robust given that certain software aspects could not be overridden by pilots. It is further assumed that Boeing certification engineers possessed the technical knowledge to understand these risks but were influenced by organizational pressure.

### Proposed Prevention Strategies

To avoid future ethical failures, reforms are required at three levels:

* **Individual:** Mandatory ethics training for engineers and managers focusing on public safety over corporate loyalty.


* **Organizational:** Establishing independent safety review boards with the power to halt certification and robust whistleblower protections. Boeing’s legal teams must also allow leadership to claim responsibility for mistakes to maintain public trust.


* **Systemic:** Ending the "delegated authority" model to ensure regulatory independence for the FAA. Agencies must uphold stricter ethical standards so safety never becomes a competitive disadvantage.
