## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/portfoliopfp.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a highly motivated Mechanical Engineering student, determined to one day join the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Passionate about the intersection of engineering and art/design, specifically in regards to the design of highly efficient passenger vehicles. Having experience in various applications of Mechanical Engineering such as CAD, CFD, FEA, DFX, Computer Programming, Robotics, and Process Engineering, my diverse skillset makes me a valuable asset to virtually any engineering team.

Along with my technical abilities, my communication and leadership skills allow me to thrive in management and developmental roles as well. I exemplify these qualities in my leadership roles as Treasurer of both the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). More quantifiably, in my latter position, I was responsible for more than $5000 in company sponsorships that were put towards funding the 2024 NSBE Region 1 Upstate Fall Zone Conference.
